**Thesis Title: Dark side of Mobile Phone Technology: Assessing the Impact of Self-Phubbing and Partner-Phubbing on Life Satfaction.:** 


**Abstract:** 

Assessing the Impact of Self-Phubbing and Partner-Phubbing on Life Satisfaction" delves into the examination of how self-phubbing (ignoring others for one's phone) and partner-phubbing (ignoring one's partner for the phone) influence life satisfaction. The study employs a quantitative approach to analyze the prevalence and consequences of these behaviors within the realm of mobile phone usage. Results indicate a significant negative correlation between self-phubbing, partner-phubbing, and overall life satisfaction levels among individuals. These findings shed light on the detrimental effects of excessive mobile phone usage on interpersonal relationships and personal well-being, prompting considerations for interventions and strategies to promote healthier digital habits and enhance overall life satisfaction. This study addresses broader societal ramifications in addition to the dynamics of particular relationships. This study promotes a more mindful use of 
smartphones by exposing the complex relationships between technology use, relationship happiness, and general life contentment. This will ultimately lead to healthier relationships and improved societal well-being.

**Keywords:** Phubbing, cellphone conflicts, communication quality, relationship satisfaction, life satisfaction.


**Research Findings:**
The results of this survey show that smartphone conflicts harm relationship satisfaction but not communication quality. It was revealed that communication quality does not directly bring a negative    impact on life satisfaction, but it directly affects relationship satisfaction, which, in turn, harms life satisfaction.



**Contributions:**
This research addresses the gap and gives insight into the consequences of self and partner phubbing and its impact on the relationship and life satisfaction among partners by providing a research model that was validated with primary data.

**2. Thesis Title: Development of a Neurofeedback Approach for ADHD Children**

 
**Abstract:**

Online addiction to social media, video games, and other kinds of online pleasure is a 1
common symptom of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This neurodevelopmental 2
disease affects many American children. New and better ADHD treatments, such as neurofeedback 3
(NF), are being actively investigated by researchers. The goal of this research is to determine whether 4
NF is effective in treating ADHD in children and adults of varying ages. Children as young as 5
six years old and as old as eighteen years old were among the several age groups represented in 6
this study. None of the students who underwent an electroencephalogram (EEG) with 19 channels 7
showed signs of ADHD or above-average intellect. This meta-analysis set out to determine whether 8
NF helped children with ADHD who had been officially diagnosed with symptoms of inattention, 9
hyperactivity, and impulsivity. The effects on inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity were both 10
statistically and practically significant, according to the results. In the end, we want to use EEG-based 11
databases and a variety of approaches to build prototypes for online classroom monitoring and 12
performance assessments.


**Research Findings:**

The research findings on the development of a neurofeedback approach for ADHD children reveal promising outcomes in managing symptoms and improving attentional control. Through targeted neurofeedback training, children with ADHD exhibit enhanced self-regulation abilities, reduced impulsivity, and improved attention span. The neurofeedback protocol enables participants to learn to modulate their brain activity, leading to significant improvements in attentional and behavioral outcomes over time. Moreover, the findings suggest that neurofeedback interventions offer a non-invasive and effective alternative to traditional pharmacological treatments, emphasizing the potential of neurofeedback as a valuable therapeutic tool for ADHD management in children.

**3. Thesis Title: Image Captioning in Bengali Language Using Visual Attention**



**Abstract:**

Automatically generating image captions poses as one of the most challenging
applications within artificial intelligence due to its integration of computer vision and
natural language processing algorithms. This task becomes notably more formidable
when dealing with a language as intricate as Bengali and the overall scarcity of
Bengali-captioned image databases. In this investigation, a meticulously
human-annotated dataset of Bengali captions has been curated specifically for the
encompassing collection of pictures. Simultaneously, for the objective of crafting
pertinent image descriptions in the Bengali language, an innovative end-to-end
architecture has been introduced, leveraging an attention-driven decoder. Initially, the
amalgamation of images’ spatial and temporal attributes is facilitated by Gated
Recurrent Units, constituting the input features. These features are subsequently fed
into the attention layer, alongside embedded caption features. The attention mechanism
scrutinizes the interrelation between visual and linguistic representations, encompassing
both categories of representations. Later, a comprehensive recursive unit comprising two
layers employs the amalgamated attention traits to construct coherent sentences. By
utilizing our furnished dataset, this model undergoes training, culminating in
achievements of 43% BLEU-4 score, 39% METEOR score, and 47% ROUGE score. In
comparison with all preceding endeavors in the realm of Bengali image captioning, these
outcomes signify the pinnacle of current attainable standards.


**Research Findings:**

Image captioning in Bengali language utilizing visual attention mechanisms yields promising outcomes. By integrating visual attention, the model demonstrates enhanced accuracy and relevance in generating captions for images. Through the attention mechanism, the model effectively focuses on salient regions of the image, enabling it to produce captions that better encapsulate the contextual nuances and linguistic intricacies specific to the Bengali language. This approach not only improves the quality of image understanding but also ensures more coherent and culturally relevant descriptions, catering to the linguistic nuances and preferences of Bengali-speaking users. Such findings underscore the efficacy of attention-based techniques in bridging the gap between visual perception and natural language understanding in the context of Bengali image captioning.

**Thesis Title: Stock Market Analysis Using Twitter Sentiment**


**Abstract:**

Recently happening the epidemic which have impacted the importance inquiring
ability of our daily life styles. Sentiments have clothed to be a huge impact at the mo-
tion of the inventory change and pandemic has satisfactory introduced greater steam.
This study with the limelight at the recent pandemic is a try to analyze the magnifi-
cence accuracy of determined-on algorithms for sentiment evaluation and prediction
for the inventory costs. We’ve attempted to take a look at proposed framework for
sentiment analysis and prediction for the ideas to discover the correlation among peo-
ple and forum sentiment. We use twitter records to anticipate public temper and use
the anticipated mood and previous days. We have considerably utilized DJIA values
for a certain time period and also tweet values for understanding people’s sentiment
on which we are looking ahead to the inventory market actions. After this, checking
highlights the accurate process or methods or algorithms based mostly on processed
outcomes. Then the ones algorithms may be enough to give input for building active
prediction systems such we want.

**Research Findings:**
Stock market prediction using sentiment analysis reveal intriguing insights into the relationship between market sentiment and stock price movements. Through sentiment analysis of social media, news articles, and other textual data sources, the study demonstrates a correlation between sentiment trends and subsequent fluctuations in stock prices. Positive sentiment tends to precede upward trends in stock prices, while negative sentiment often anticipates downturns. Moreover, the research highlights the potential for sentiment analysis models to provide valuable predictive signals for investors and traders, offering insights into market sentiment dynamics that can inform more informed investment decisions. However, the study also underscores the challenges of accurately interpreting and incorporating sentiment data into stock market forecasting models, emphasizing the need for further refinement and validation of sentiment analysis techniques in financial markets.
